CUSTOMER REVIEWS:
----------------------------------------

Review 1 - Sarah M. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Best headphones I've ever owned! The noise cancellation is incredible - I can't
hear my noisy neighbors anymore. Battery lasts forever and they're super comfortable
even during long work sessions. Worth every penny!"

Review 2 - Mike T. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Great sound quality and the ANC works well. Only giving 4 stars because the
Bluetooth occasionally drops when my phone is in my back pocket. Otherwise fantastic
value for the price."

Review 3 - Jennifer L. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"I use these for my daily 2-hour commute and they've been a game changer. The
transparency mode is perfect for announcements on the train. Very impressed with
build quality."

Review 4 - David R. (Verified Purchase) - 3 stars
"Sound is good but they feel a bit tight on my head. After about 2 hours I need
to take a break. The noise cancellation is decent but not as good as the premium
brands. Good for the price though."

Review 5 - Amanda K. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Bought these for my son's birthday and he absolutely loves them. Great for
gaming and music. The microphone quality is surprisingly good for video calls too."
