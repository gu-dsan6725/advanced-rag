Review 1 - Emily R. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Finally found the perfect yoga mat! The thickness is just right - my knees don't
hurt during kneeling poses anymore. The grip is amazing even when I sweat during
hot yoga. Love the sage green color too!"

Review 2 - Michael B. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Good quality mat for the price. Took a few days for the initial smell to go away
but now it's fine. Grip is excellent and it hasn't stretched or torn after 6 months
of daily use."

Review 3 - Priya K. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"As a yoga instructor, I've tried dozens of mats. This one offers excellent value.
My students always ask about it. The carrying strap is a nice bonus. Will definitely
buy another when this one wears out."

Review 4 - Tom J. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Use this for my daily stretching routine and occasional yoga. The cushioning is
perfect for my hardwood floors. Very happy with the purchase. Cleaning is easy -
just wipe it down and let it air dry."

Review 5 - Sophia L. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Great mat overall! Only issue is it's slightly slippery when completely dry. Once
I warm up a bit and have some moisture on my hands, the grip is perfect. Beautiful
purple color exactly as pictured."
