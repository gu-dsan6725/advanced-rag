CUSTOMER REVIEWS:

Review 1 - Alex C. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"This book took me from zero programming knowledge to building my own web app in
3 months. The explanations are clear, and the exercises really reinforce the
concepts. Dr. Mitchell has a gift for making complex topics accessible."

Review 2 - Jennifer W. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"As a self-taught programmer, I had gaps in my knowledge. This book filled them
all. The OOP section finally made inheritance click for me. The projects at the end
of each chapter are practical and relevant. Highly recommend!"

Review 3 - Daniel K. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Great content and well-structured. The only reason for 4 stars is some of the
advanced chapters move a bit fast. But for beginners, the first 2/3 of the book
is absolutely perfect. Worth the investment."

Review 4 - Michelle P. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"I'm a teacher and I use this book for my high school programming class. Students
love it! The examples are engaging and the progression is logical. The online
resources are an excellent bonus."

Review 5 - Ryan H. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Solid programming book. Covers a lot of ground. Some sections feel rushed,
especially machine learning - that topic really deserves its own book. But as an
all-in-one Python guide, it's excellent value."
