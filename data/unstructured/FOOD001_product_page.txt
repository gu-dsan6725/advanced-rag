CUSTOMER REVIEWS:
----------------------------------------

Review 1 - Coffee Lover (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"This is the best coffee I've had outside of a specialty cafe! The chocolate notes
are prominent and the finish is so smooth. No bitterness at all. I've subscribed
for monthly delivery - that's how much I love it."

Review 2 - Nancy G. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"My husband is very picky about coffee and he approves! Great for French press and
pour-over. The beans are fresh and aromatic. Love that it's organic and fair trade.
Feels good to enjoy quality coffee ethically."

Review 3 - Tom R. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Really good coffee, fresh roast, nice flavor profile. I prefer a darker roast
personally but this medium roast is excellent for what it is. The citrus notes
are subtle and pleasant. Will order again."

Review 4 - Maria P. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Makes the perfect espresso! The crema is beautiful and the taste is balanced.
I've tried many organic coffees and this is by far the best. The resealable bag
keeps it fresh. Highly recommend for espresso lovers!"

Review 5 - Jake H. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Solid everyday coffee. Fresh, flavorful, and smooth. My only minor gripe is I
wish they offered a dark roast option. But for medium roast fans, this is
excellent. Fast shipping too - arrived within 3 days."
