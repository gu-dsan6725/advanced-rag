CUSTOMER REVIEWS:

Review 1 - Jessica T. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"My golden retriever has never been healthier! His coat is so shiny and he has so
much energy. He used to have digestive issues but since switching to this food,
no more problems. He absolutely loves the taste too!"

Review 2 - Mark W. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Finally found a dog food my picky eater loves! My french bulldog has allergies
and this food doesn't trigger them. The ingredient list is actually readable -
real food, not mystery fillers. Great quality."

Review 3 - Linda C. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Good quality dog food. My lab mix enjoys it and his stools are more consistent
now. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for. The bag could use a better reseal
mechanism though - had to transfer to a container."

Review 4 - Steve B. (Verified Purchase) - 5 stars
"Our vet recommended a higher quality food and this fit the bill. Two months in
and our 8-year-old border collie has more energy than ever. Her joints seem less
stiff too - probably the glucosamine. Highly recommend!"

Review 5 - Emily R. (Verified Purchase) - 4 stars
"Solid dog food with quality ingredients. My corgi loves it. Only giving 4 stars
because the kibble size is a bit large for smaller dogs - I have to break some
pieces for my small pup. Otherwise excellent product."
